Path/Motion Planning plugin for V-REP simulator

I'm not sure someone is still intersted in this project... but just in case.

Since V3.3.0(Feb 19th 2016), V-REP simulator adapts OMPL as an official
path planning module instead of built-in path planning plugin which is deprecated(
still usable, but not recommended)

I found that the only benefit of this plugin is easy to read and modify due to the
simpliticity. But, the most important things is *Extensibility* which made me conclude 
to quit this project. Also huge of state-of-the-art algorithms such as RRT* is already
implemented there.

See you in OMPL.
